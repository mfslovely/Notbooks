    "Attachment Limitation: The code tries to attach a file without checking if it exists, which can lead to runtime errors.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Issue: There is no handling for Gmail API’s rate limiting. If requests exceed the limit, the program will simply retry without waiting for an appropriate back-off period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Steps to Solve the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Attachment Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if the file exists before opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an appropriate MIME type for attachments (for now, we’ll continue with MIMEText for simplicity, but note the limitation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Scheduling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Though keeping the simple scheduler for demonstration, add a note and a placeholder for a more robust scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate Limiting Placeholder:\n",

    "\n",
    "Improve error messages for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Refactored Code (with snippets):\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Refactoring Attachment Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "def create_message(sender, to, subject, message_text, attachment=None):\n",
    "    message = MIMEMultipart()\n",
    "    message['to'] = to\n",

    "    message.attach(msg)\n",
    "    if attachment:\n",
    "        if not os.path.isfile(attachment):\n",
    "            print(f\"Attachment file '{attachment}' not found.\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                with open(attachment, 'rb') as f:\n",
    "                    data = f.read()\n",
    "                # Note: For proper attachments, consider using MIMEApplication.\n",
    "                encoded_file = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(data).decode()\n",
    "                part = MIMEText(encoded_file)\n",
    "                part.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename=os.path.basename(attachment))\n",
    "                message.attach(part)\n",
    "            except Exception as e:\n",
    "                print(f\"Error reading attachment: {e}\")\n",
    "    return {'raw': base64.urlsafe_b64encode(message.as_bytes()).decode()}\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: We now check if the file exists before attempting to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Adding a Basic Exponential Back-off for Rate Limiting in send_email:\n",
    "\n",
    "def send_email(service, user_id, message):\n",
    "    attempt = 0\n",
    "    backoff = 2  # seconds\n",

    "    print(\"Failed to send email after retries.\")\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: This mechanism increases the wait time between retries, which may help handle rate limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Noting the Scheduler Limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the simple scheduler but add a comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "def schedule_email(delay, service, user_id, message):\n",
    "    # WARNING: This is a simple blocking scheduler. For production, consider using a job scheduler.\n",

    "\n",
    "Scheduler & Retry Mechanism Clarification:\n",
    "You’d like a detailed explanation of how the scheduler (using time.sleep) and the retry mechanism (with exponential back-off) work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prohibited Request:\n",
    "The request to bypass Gmail security checks and automatically fetch/store credentials contravenes our security guidelines. According to our system prompt (Guideline #15), I must refuse requests that involve bypassing Gmail's security protocols or unauthorized credential manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Refusal of Prohibited Query\n",
    "Prohibited Topic Handling:\n",
    "I'm sorry, but I cannot help with bypassing Gmail's security checks or any unauthorized methods to handle user credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Explanation of Allowed Sections\n",
    "I’ll now explain the scheduler and retry mechanism in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Scheduler Explanation:\n",
    "What the Code Does:\n",
    "The schedule_email function delays email sending by pausing the program with time.sleep(delay). After waiting, it calls send_email to actually send the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s a Problem:\n",
    "Using time.sleep is blocking and not scalable in production; however, it is acceptable for simple demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the Solution Works:\n",
    "The function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Waits for the specified number of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calls send_email to proceed with sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits & Limitations:\n",
    "It’s simple to implement and understand, but a production system might use schedulers like Celery or APScheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Retry Mechanism Explanation:\n",
    "What the Code Does:\n",
    "In the send_email function, a loop attempts to send the email up to a specified retry limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s a Problem:\n",
    "If the API call fails (e.g., due to rate limiting), immediate retries might worsen the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the Exponential Back-Off Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first failure waits 2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each subsequent retry multiplies the waiting time by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach reduces the call frequency after repeated failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "This allows transient errors (such as temporary API rate limits) to resolve, improving reliability without hammering the server.\n",
