    "\n",
    "Step 1: Understand the Problems Clearly\n",

    "Issue 1: The search_rooms function iterates over every room even if a room is found early. This can slow down the system when many rooms exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue 2: The calculate_total method processes services redundantly without caching or early exits.\n",

    "\n",
    "Issue 4: The class is not modular – functions are all lumped together, which hinders maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Refactor the Search Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We can improve performance by using list comprehensions, which are more efficient and concise.\n",

    "    available = []\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 3: Optimize Calculate Total\n",

    "Here, we will cache the price and avoid unnecessary iterations if no services exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_total(self, booking):\n",
    "    total = booking['price']\n",
