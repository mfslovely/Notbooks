    "File Writing: Use Python’s CSV module to write the data to a new CSV file.\n",

    "Problem: The BFS function is meant to traverse a graph but it lacks proper cycle handling, node existence checking, visited tracking, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s a Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycle Issue: Without a visited set, cycles (like 'G' → 'A' or 'M' → 'J') cause repeated processing, potentially leading to infinite loops.\n",

    "Non-existent Node: If the start node isn’t in the graph (e.g., 'Z'), the function doesn’t validate input, resulting in unexpected behavior.\n",

    "Redundant Processing: No visited check means nodes can be enqueued multiple times, leading to performance issues.\n",

    "Output Limitations: The function only prints the BFS order instead of returning it for further use.\n",
