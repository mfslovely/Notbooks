    "Step 2: Identify Specific Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicate Courses: Appending without a check lets duplicates slip in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Management: Although the example is simple, using a list for courses and lack of cleanup might lead to increased memory usage in extensive systems.\n",

    "Debugging Enhancements: Missing __str__ or __repr__ means the printed output isn’t informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure Choice: A set might be more efficient for membership checks, but it may not preserve order—so we must decide based on requirements.\n",

    "Step 3: Proposed Modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevent Duplicate Courses: Modify the add_course method to check if the course exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhance Debug Output: Implement the __str__ method for the Student class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Course Storage: Depending on your use case, we can start by switching from a list to a set. If order is needed, we might use an ordered set or simply check before appending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Considerations: While major memory management might involve more advanced patterns (like object pooling or cleanup routines), we’ll ensure our data structures are optimized for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Update Code – Duplicate Check and str Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",

    "Update the book_appointment method to generate an ID when an appointment is created.\n",
