    "\n",
    "Step 1: Understanding the Problems Clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardcoded Connection Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The connection details for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite are hardcoded into a global configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: This makes the code inflexible and error-prone if any parameter changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Validation of Credentials/Inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The system does not validate if the user-provided parameters (or connection details) are correct before trying to connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Causes crashes if the parameters are invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Comprehensive Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: While there is a try-except block for MySQL, it immediately falls back to PostgreSQL and then to SQLite with minimal logging and no cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Hides the real source of errors and can lead to resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monolithic Query Execution Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The function execute_query mixes connection selection and query execution in one block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Makes debugging and extending the system (for instance, to support parameterized queries) very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsafe SQL Construction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The query is built using string concatenation, which is insecure and can lead to SQL injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Poses a significant security risk.\n",

    "Step 2: Identifying Issues with Snippets\n",

    "\n",
    "Optimized Code Structure: Modularized code into functions (fetch_webpage, parse_html, save_to_excel, etc.) for clarity.\n",
    "\n",

    "Issue: Direct string concatenation, not safe for user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Steps to Solve the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Externalize and Validate Configuration: Use configuration files or environment variables with validation.\n",

    "Modularize Connection Functions: Separate connection logic with proper exception handling and logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhance Error Handling: Use try-except blocks with logging and ensure proper resource cleanup.\n",
