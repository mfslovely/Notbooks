    "Let’s address your issues step by step to optimize performance, enhance error handling, and improve the modularity of the Hotel Booking Management System.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Understand the Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The nested loop inside book_room unnecessarily delays the room search, especially problematic with a larger list of rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of checks for parameters like guest and preference risks unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intertwined logic for room availability and booking impedes future scalability and maintenance.\n",

    "Step 2: Identify Code Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner loop that iterates over room characters simulates delay and is not functionally required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters such as guest and preference should be validated to avoid null or invalid inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The availability check is directly embedded in the booking loop, reducing code clarity.\n",
