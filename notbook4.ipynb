    "\n",
    "Issue: No exception handling for S3 connection failures.\n",

    "Transform Stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: Assumes every row has complete and valid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s a Problem: Missing or bad data will cause type conversion (e.g., converting an empty string to float) to crash the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load Stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: No error handling around the database connection or inserts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s a Problem: Connection issues or bad SQL queries can cause unhandled exceptions, halting the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: There’s no logging at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s a Problem: Without logging, diagnosing which ETL stage fails is extremely difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity & Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: The pipeline is monolithic.\n",
    "\n",

    "Below is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the issues with your Celery-based automated workflow and the refactored code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Understanding the Problems Clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "Problem: Each task (extract, transform, load, notify) lacks exception management.\n",
    "Why It’s Problematic: A failure in any API call, data conversion, or DB connection will crash the worker, causing the entire workflow to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Chaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The workflow manually calls .get() after each task rather than chaining tasks asynchronously.\n",
    "Why It’s Problematic: This creates blocking calls, losing the benefits of Celery’s async processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: There’s minimal logging.\n",
    "Why It’s Problematic: Without logging, pinpointing and diagnosing failures is very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Result Tracking:\n",
    "Problem: The code doesn’t properly track or handle task failures; the results are only obtained by blocking calls.\n",
    "Why It’s Problematic: A task might fail silently if its exception isn’t recorded or propagated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The pipeline is monolithic, with tasks and workflow orchestration tightly coupled.\n",
    "Why It’s Problematic: It hinders maintenance, extension, and reuse of individual tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Identifying Issues in the Original Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling Omission in extract_data:\n",
    "\n",
    "response = requests.get(api_url)\n",
    "\n",
    "data = response.json()\n",

    "\n",
    "data = extract_data.delay(api_url).get()\n",

    "Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling with self.retry():\n",
    "\n",
    "What It Does:\n",
    "In each task, when an exception occurs, self.retry() is called. This tells Celery to automatically retry the task after a specified countdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s Beneficial:\n",
    "It provides resilience against temporary failures (like network timeouts or transient DB issues) by trying the task again without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "The task will be rescheduled with the same arguments and a delay defined by countdown=5. The max_retries parameter limits how many times a task will be retried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Chaining with chain():\n",
    "\n",
    "What It Does:\n",
    "chain() allows you to link multiple tasks in a sequence so that the output of one task automatically becomes the input of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It’s Beneficial:\n",
    "This preserves the workflow order asynchronously, ensuring that subsequent processing depends on the successful completion of the previous task.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "In our workflow, the output from extract_data is passed as input to transform_data, then to load_data, and finally to send_notification.\n",

    "New Feature: After the workflow finishes, produce a summary of task statistics (such as retries) and send this summary within the notification email.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simulate Retry Statistics:\n",
